THE CAST COULD HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.</font> </h3>
 <img src="images/friends/friends cast different.webp"
height="450" width="420" >
 </div>
 
 <div class="text">
 
 <p> <font color="white"> 1) With a cast of six people,
 it’s not a surprise that many different actors were
considered
 for each role. For example, Kathy Griffin and Jane Lynch
actually
 became friends after meeting while both were auditioning
for
 the part of Phoebe.
 Both Jon Favreau and Jon Cryer were considered for the
role of
 Chandler before it went to Matthew Perry, but Perry
almost
 didn’t get the gig either. During the 1994 pilot season,
he
 filmed the pilot for a show called LAX 2194 in addition
to
 Friends. The show would have been about baggage handlers
at LAX
 who sorted aliens’ luggage. Thankfully, it wasn’t picked
up, and
 Perry was able to take the Friends gig.</font>

 <div class="text">
 <p> 2) <font color="white"> 2) Before the show premiered,
Courteney Cox was probably the most famous cast member.
 She was known for many commercials plus Bruce
Springsteen’s “Dancing in the Dark” music video. The Friends
 producers originally asked her to play Rachel, but
she requested the role of Monica because she liked the “strong” character.</font>

 <div class="text">
 
 <p> <font color="white"> 3) This may come as a
surprise because Eric McCormack (best known as Will of Will & Grace)
 made news when he said that he auditioned “two
or three times” for Ross. But, executive producer Kevin Bright
 had worked with Schwimmer before, so the
writers were already developing Ross’s character in Schwimmer’s voice.
 And indeed, Schwimmer was the first person
cast on the show. </font>

 <p> <font color="white"> 4) Don’t let your
New York City tour guide trick you into thinking that you’re looking at the fountain
 from the iconic opening credits of
Friends—unless you’ve brought your tour guide with you to Burbank
 for some reason. Although the fountain
looks a lot like Central Park's Pulitzer Fountain, the actual
 shoot occurred on a Warner Bros. lot.

 <p> <font color="white"> 5) Director James
Burrows,
 who went on to direct a handful of episodes
for
 the show between 1995 and 1997, brought the
six
 cast members to Vegas because he “had a
feeling index3.html
localhost:4649/?mode=htmlmixed 7/9
 about the show.” While they were at
Caesar’s Palace,
 he encouraged the group to enjoy
themselves.
 “This is your last shot at anonymity,”
Burrows told them.
 “Once the show comes on the air, you
guys will never be
 able to go anywhere without being
hounded.” </font>

<font color="white"> FRIENDS WAS FILMED IN FRONT OF A LIVE AUDIENCE—EXCEPT FOR
CLIFFHANGERS. </font> </h3>
 <img src="images/friends/ross and emily wedding.jpg" >
 </div>
 
 <div class="text">
 
 
 <p> <font color="white"> 6) Shooting an
episode of Friends was a lengthy process,
 typically lasting five hours, with
multiple takes per scene and 20 minutes
 between scenes to change sets.
Still, the show was filmed in front of a live
 audience made up of 300 fans. And
that’s the way the cast preferred it.
 “It’s kind of like a test to see
if the material works, if the jokes work,
 if the story tracks,” LeBlanc
said. Perry agreed, “Our energy just elevates
 every time there’s an audience.”
 So, what wasn’t filmed in front
of a live audience? One example
 is the cliffhanger in the season
four finale, “The One With Ross’s
 Wedding.” At the end of the
episode, Ross is about to marry Emily,
 but accidentally says Rachel’s
name at the altar. “We couldn’t have
 an audience for that,” Aniston
said. “We always remove the audience
 for the cliffhangers because,
obvious reasons, you don’t want to spoil it.”

 <p> <font color="white"> 7) In
1997, Perry went to rehab for an addiction
 to prescription drugs and
alcohol. He went again in 2001. He later
 told People, “I was never
high at work. I was painfully hung over.
 Then eventually things
got so bad I couldn’t hide it and everybody knew.”
