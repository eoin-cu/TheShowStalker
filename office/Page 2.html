                               <p>“The climate’s different. I mean, the whole idea of that character, Michael Scott,
                                 so much of it was predicated on inappropriate behavior. I mean, he’s certainly not a model boss. 
                                 A lot of what is depicted on that show is completely wrong-minded. That’s the point, you know?
                                  But I just don’t know how that would fly now. There’s a very high awareness of offensive things
                                   today—which is good, for sure. But at the same time, when you take a character like that too 
                                   literally, it doesn’t really work.”

                             and then iTunes came out. And people started buying the show for, like, $1.99. 
                            They were buying a show that they could see for free on Thursdays, which I think blew everybody's 
                            brain at the network. That’s the reason why we stayed on, 
                                and then we caught fire on our own way. So every time someone comes up to me and says, you know, 
                                'Is it a bummer that you'll only be known as Jim?' I say, 'First of all,
